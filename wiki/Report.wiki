= To Do =
  * Write a program which splits an audio data into many files according to given window and hop sizes.
  * Add [http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ GNU Scientific Library] for FFT and function minimization algorithms to the project.
  * Implement a GUI which displays a waveform of an audio file for offline usage.
  * Implement Oscilloscope and Spectroscope for online usage(1).
  * Implement Peak Detection algorithm(1).
  * Implement TWM(1).


= Done =
  * *9 May 2009* FFTW: http://www.fftw.org/ a crossplatform FFT library is added to the project. Fourier transform of some sample frames are taken and it is checked that the system works correct.
  * *4 May 2009* A .wav file is read successfully. A little program (stereo2mono) is written which reads an entire stereo sound file and writes its left and right channels into two different mono sound files.
  * *2 May 2009* Add Cross-platform soundfile input output library [http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/ libsndfile] to the project  
  * Cross-platform realtime audio API [http://www.portaudio.com/ portaudio] is compiled and tested
  * Cross-platform GUI and Threading API [http://www.libsdl.org/ SDL] is compiled and tested
